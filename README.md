# Starseeker - utils
## A collection of OS utilities written in Python

utils is meant to be a small CLI program to handle easy scripting issues, any forks or pull requests are welcomed!

### What I use for virtual enviroment management

I prefer to use poetry, but I believe pipenv is better for production enviroments. This small, personal project uses poetry.

    Make sure you have poetry:
        pip install poetry
    
    And then, create the virtual enviroment and handle dependencies:
        poetry install
        poetry run

### Running the app

This is a CLI app, make sure you built the needed dependencies. To start the app just run:
        python main.py
